# Project_opus_1

## Description

Looking for events over a seven day period? Need to know what the weather is like on that day? This project aims to address these.

Using geolocation, or a user input, you can search for events within a certain area. The weather is given from the same input, so that the user has current conditions and forecast.

## User Story

Given that I am a music lover who is looking for events near me then I need to be able
to navigate to the venue. Given I need a webpage to view which events are in my area,
then I will want a service to guide me.
