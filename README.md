# Project_opus_1

## Description

This project is an application for finding events, specifically concerts, within a certain area.

Using geolocation, this application queries a third-party API to search within a certain radius and time period for concert events. This application then uses the same geolocation information to search for the weather, and then displays the temperature and conditions for the day of the event.

This application utilizes jQuery, moment.js, and geohash.js to power this application. The CSS framework used is the Semantic UI. The third-party API's used are TicketMaster and Weatherbit.io.

## User Story

Given that I am a music lover who is looking for events near me then I need to be able
to navigate to the venue. Given I need a webpage to view which events are in my area,
then I will want a service to guide me.
